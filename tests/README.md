# Tests Directory

Organize challenge test code and fixtures by language at the first subfolder level:

- `tests/python/` — Python 3.11+ tests
- `tests/go/` — Go tests
- `tests/rust/` — Rust tests
- `tests/powershell/` — PowerShell Core tests

Place language-specific unit/integration tests alongside any helpers or fixtures. Keep generated artifacts and compiled outputs out of version control.***
