## Project conventions

- Follow semantic versioning for all releases.
- Use Conventional Commits for commit messages.
- Keep each scoped change in its own commit.
- When a PR is merged, switch back to `main` and `git pull` to sync before further work.
- When on `main` and making changes, create a new branch for the work (branch protection requires PRs).
- Write clear, concise PR descriptions summarizing changes and tests.
- After every commit, review and update the PR description (and title if needed) so it matches the latest changes.
